Script that carries out neural style transfer. 

It can read images from content and style image folders, and then stylize every content image with every style image. Further, there is an option to either preserve the color space of the content image or the style image to make the stylized image. 

The variables `style_weight, content_weight, var_weight, initial_learning_rate, epochs` may need to be adjusted depending on the content and style image for optimal results.
